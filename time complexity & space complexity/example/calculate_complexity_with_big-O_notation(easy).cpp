3. Quadratic Time Complexity Big-O(n^c): ->indicates how many loops running inside it
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += c) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j += c) {
            // some O(1) expressions

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += c) {
        fn1();  -> let fn1() has another n-length array with single for loop so time complexity is Big-O(n^2)
    }




4. Logarithmic Time Complexity Big-O(Log n):
    The time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(Logn) if the loop variables are divided/multiplied
    by a constant amount. And also for recursive calls in the recursive function, the Time Complexity
    is considered as O(Logn).

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i = i * c) {
        // some O(1) expressions

        n = n / 2;
        // some O(1) expressions
    }
    /*
    why binary search Time Complexity: Big-O(log n)?
    we take n-length array, each time we divide the n-length array by 2 which is n/2 because of half the array.

    in code,int arr[] = {7, 9, 10, 13, 19, 25, 29}; int key = 7;
    1st iteration,
        array   ->  7 9 10 13 19 25 29  =>  divide and take left half array   =>  7 9 10    (n/2 size)
    2nd iteration,
        array   ->  7 9 10   =>  divide and take left half array   =>  7    (n/4 size) -> (n/(2*2))
        ....
        ....

    k iteration,
         array   ->  7  => left only one variable in array  => (n/(2^k) size) [ here, k = total iteration]

    let, n/(2^k) = 1    [here, 1 is the length of array when last iteration happen]
        => n = 2^k
        => log(n) = log(2^k)
        => logn = k * 1
        => k = logn

    so, Time Complexity: Big-O(log n)

5. Logarithmic Time Complexity Big-O(nLog n):
    The Time Complexity of a single loop is considered as O(n).
    The time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(Logn) if the loop variables are divided/multiplied
    by a constant amount. And also for recursive calls in the recursive function, the Time Complexity
    is considered as O(Logn).

    here, we play nested loop. the outer loop Time Complexity is O(n) and the inner loop Time Complexity is O(Logn).

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += c) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j = j * c) {
            // some O(1) expressions
        }
    }




6. Logarithmic Time Complexity Big-O(Log(Log n)):
    The Time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(LogLogn) if the loop variables are reduced/increased
    exponentially by a constant amount.

    // Here c is a constant greater than 1
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i = pow(i, c)) {
        // some O(1) expressions
    }
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    // Here fun is sqrt or cuberoot or any other constant root
    for (int i = n; i > 1; i = fun(i)) {
        // some O(1) expressions
    }



7. Logarithmic Time Complexity Big-O((Log n)^2) -> Big-O(Log n * Log n):
    The time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(Logn) if the loop variables are divided/multiplied
    by a constant amount. And also for recursive calls in the recursive function, the Time Complexity
    is considered as O(Logn).

    int count = 0;
    // Executes O(Log n) times
    for (int i=1; i<=n; i=i*2)
    {
        // Executes O(Log n) times
        for (int j=1; j<=n; j=j*2)
        {
            count++;
        }
    }
    // Time Complexity: O(logn * logn) =O(n log^2 (n))



8. Function call statements
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += c) {
        fn1();
    }
    let fn1() has another n-length array with nested for loop so time complexity is Big-O(n * n^2) = Big-O(n^3).
    if fn1() time complexity is Big-O(log n). so final time complexity is Big-O(n log n).
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    if (isValid) {
      array.sort();  -> time complexity of sort() is Big-O(n log n)
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
    so time complexity is Big-O(n log n).
    note: without array.sort(), it will be Big-O(1)




9.How to combine the time complexities of consecutive loops?
    When there are consecutive loops, we calculate time complexity as a sum of the
    time complexities of individual loops.

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i += c) {
        // some O(1) expressions
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += c) {
        // some O(1) expressions
    }

    Time complexity of above code is O(m) + O(n) which is O(m + n)
    If m == n, the time complexity becomes O(n + n) which is O(n).

    for(int i=0; i<size(arr2); i++)

        if(arr2[i] == key)

            cout<<"found the number."<<endl<<endl;
        }
    }
    // n-length array, we search every index to get the key. so, time complexity is Big-O(n)



//example 7:
    int N = 5;
    for(int i=1; i<=N; i++)
    {
        for(int j=1; j<=N; j++)
