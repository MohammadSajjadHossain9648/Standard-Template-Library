    Run-time Constant:
    These are the constants whose respective values can only be known or computed at the time of running of source
    code. Run time Constants are a bit slower than compile-time constants but are more flexible than compile-time
    constants. However, once it is initialized, the value of these constants can’t be changed.

    when we input in console, that is runtime constant.

    like an example:
        cout<<"Enter a number: ";
        int y;
        cin>>y;
