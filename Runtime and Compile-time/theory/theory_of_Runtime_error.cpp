    Runtime errors
    The runtime errors are the errors that occur during the execution and after compilation. The examples of
    runtime errors are division by zero, etc. These errors are not easy to detect as the compiler does not point
    to these errors.

/*
    Runtime errors
    A program’s life cycle is a runtime when the program is in execution. Following are the different types of
    runtime errors:
    1.Division by zero – when a number is divided by zero (0)
    2.Dereferencing a null pointer – when a program attempts to access memory with a NULL
    3.Running out of memory – when a computer has no memory to allocate to programs
