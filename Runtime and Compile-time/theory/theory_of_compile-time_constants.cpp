/*
    Compile-time is the time at which the source code is converted into an executable code
    while the run time is the time at which the executable code is started running.
    Both the compile-time and runtime refer to different types of error.

/*
    Compile-time Constant:
    These are the constants whose respective value is known or computed at the time of compilation of source code.
    Compile-time constants are faster than run-time constants but are less flexible than run-time constants.

    A Compile-time constant is a constant whose value is known at compile-time. Literals (e.g. ‘1’, ‘2.3’, and
    “Hello, world!”) are one type of compile-time constant.

    like an example:
    const int x = 3;  // x is a compile-time const
*/
/*
    Inputs and Outputs:
    Inputs and outputs during compile time are the following:
    1.Inputs – Source code, dependent files, interfaces, libraries required for successful compilation of the code
    2.Outputs – On successful compilation, a complied code (assembly code or relocatable object code), otherwise
    compile time error messages

    Errors:
    During compile time errors occur because of syntax and semantic. The syntax error occurs because of the wrong
    syntax of the written code. Semantic errors occur in reference to variable, function, type declarations and
    type checking.
