    C++98 introduced a special container called valarray to hold and provide mathematical operations on
    arrays efficiently.

    It supports element-wise mathematical operations and various forms of generalized subscript operators,
    slicing and indirect access. As compare to vectors, valarrays are efficient in certain mathematical operations
    than vectors also.
